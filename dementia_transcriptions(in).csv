(pause for 0.7s)  I  can  remember,  for  example,  when  the  issues  around  disability  first  came  into  play. (pause for 0.9s)  And  people  said,  this  is  incredible.  We  can't  do  all  of  these  things  that  will  cost  a  fortune  for  us  to  do  it.

Abe Burrows,AbeBurrows_5.wav," to  me.  Bob  was,  he  was  worried.  When  I  became  a  performer,  he  was  worried  that  I  would  do  what  he  did.  He  gave  them  a  long  story  because  once  he  started  to  act,  he  stopped  writing. (pause for 1.6s)  Bob  told  me  a  story.  He  says,  he  stopped  writing,  gave  up  his  typewriter  and  the  Herald  Tribune,  he  told  me  a  story  once  that  the  Herald  Tribune  had  an  editorial  that  Bob  Benchley  is  giving  up  his  typewriter.

(pause for 1.6s)  But  he  walked  up  to  me  at  a  party  one  day  and  he  says,  could  you  write  a  song  for  me  called  Two  Little  Words  I  Love  You?  And  I  wrote  such  a  song. (pause for 0.6s)  And  we  became  very  good  friends.  He  was  marvelous  to  me,  but  he  was  one  who  chiefly  encouraged  me  to  stay  with  writing  and  not  just,  you  know,  when  I  was  acting,  when  I  was  performing,  after  a  while  nightclubs,  I  stopped  creating  for  a  while.  I  stopped  writing. (pause for 1.2s)  Well,  what  you  do  in  nightclubs  and  it'll  tell  you,  you  begin  to  do  the  sure  things,  your  best  things,  and  you  don't  dare  try  anything  new.
